🤖 Turing Math Machine
Hey there! This project is a tribute to the master Alan Turing. The idea was to simulate how a machine processes symbols on a tape to solve mathematical problems using JavaScript.

🧠 What is a Turing Machine, anyway?
Imagine an infinite tape made of little squares. Each square holds a symbol (a number or a + sign). The machine has a “head” that reads these symbols, figures out what to do, and produces a result. This is the foundation of everything we now call a computer!

🛠️ Technologies

JavaScript (The engine of our machine)

Node.js (To run the code)

Prettier (To ensure code standardization and cleanliness)

Git & GitHub (To keep this organized chaos under control)

🚀 How to run it

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder.

3. Run node index.js.

4. Watch the magic happen in the console! ✨
